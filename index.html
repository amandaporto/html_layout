        <h1>Summary of "A brief history of web design for designers"</h1>
        <h3>Written by Amanda Porto</h3>
        <img src="images/Evolution-of-web-hosting.jpg" alt="Evolution of the Web" />
        <p>The evolution of design as well as design tools for the web
          has been ongoing since 1989, when websites weren't easily accessible to the
          population. The interaction between computer and human was bridged by black
          backgrounds and one color tone pixels. A few years later, browsers became readily
          available and allowed pictures to be displayed to users. This revolutionary step
          together with the concept of tables that already existed within HTML gave way to
          structure of information within websites at the time. As with any technology,
          this came with known limitations as well as high maintenance for the designer and
          developer. At the same time HTML tables were becoming mainstream, Javascript
          started emerging to cover the gaps tables left on websites and to add relatively
          dynamic features to websites. Shortly after, Flash was born and allowed design with
          more freedom and animation. When 1998 came around, CSS started being used by
          developers to style the website's HTML structure - keeping structure separated
          from design. Unfortunately, the delay in browser adaptation was a concern for
          developers and designers alike. </p>
        <p>With the iPhone, came the mobile uprising which secured the way of grids and
          frameworks to make content across devices somewhat consistent and easier to adapt
          to which led to the responsive design era in 2010, when it was established that
          the same content should be displayed on different media types, but with different
          design layouts to fit different sized screens. This focus on content, inevitably
          led towards the flat design trend which placed the focus of the website on content,
          rather than distractions on the website or the design itself. Less is more became
          the new standard for nicely designed websites. </p>
        <p>Now, the trend seems to be continuing into the direction of less is more with
          an emphasis of flexibility -  a kind of flexibility that allows even those who do
          not know what HTML is, to create a relatively nice website. On the other hand, with
          the recent change into CSS3 and HTML5, more concepts have been added to make designing
          and developing for the web more pleasing to designers and developers alike. I can
          only hope that the trend of minimalism and focus on content continues with an
          increased effort towards usability and cross compatibility so a website can be seem
          as it was intended across every device and/or browser.</p>
